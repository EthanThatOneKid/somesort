## Rules ðŸ’«
Each sorting algorithm implementation is its own file, named accordingly while default-exporting its function. The collection of sorting algorithms is organized and shipped in the [index.ts](index.ts) file. Each sorting algorithm must take a variable of the type [SortList](../SortList.ts) as its first argument. Each sorting algorithm must also apply all changes to that first argument, as it is designed to be sorted [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).
